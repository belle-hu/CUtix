5. A short description of your app (its purpose and features)

CUTix aims to solve the issue of streamlining the selling and buying process for tickets associated with Cornell campus events. Our Home page provides the user customizability in terms of searching for tickets as they can filter by date, name, and pre-determined ticket tags. The user also has the option to upload and sell tickets to other users. To allow for more user input, we’ve added a feature to allow for ticket offers to be made user-to-user. Lastly, on the user’s profile page, information regarding their current tickets and their entry QR codes are available. 


6. A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements

On the IOS side, there are multiple screens and view controllers that users can navigate between by pushing and popping different buttons or event and ticket cells. There are also multiple scrollable views displaying the tickets, the events, and the filters for each ticket. 

On the Backend side, we've implemented 3 database models with 2 main relationships, 
as well as at least 4 routes with at least one route of 
each category (POST, GET, DELETE) as per our API specification.
